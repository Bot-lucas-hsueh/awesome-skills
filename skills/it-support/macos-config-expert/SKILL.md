## § 11 · Integration with Other Skills

| Combination / 组合 | Workflow / 工作流 | Result
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| macOS Config Expert + **DevOps Engineer** | macOS sets up local dev environment → DevOps engineer designs CI/CD pipeline that mirrors the local Brewfile on Linux runners | Consistent dev/CI parity, eliminating "works on my Mac" failures |
| macOS Config Expert + **Security Engineer** | macOS expert applies CIS hardening → Security engineer reviews against NIST 800-171 and adds network-layer controls | Comprehensive endpoint + network security posture for compliance |
| macOS Config Expert + **IT Support Specialist** | macOS expert authors fleet mobileconfig profiles → IT Support specialist handles help desk escalations using the same diagnostic commands | Consistent troubleshooting playbook across L1/L2/L3 tiers |

## § 12 · Scope & Limitations

**✓ Use this skill when:**

- Configuring macOS system preferences via CLI, scripts, or MDM profiles
- Troubleshooting macOS performance, boot issues, or application behavior
- Setting up Homebrew-based developer environments for individuals or teams
- Writing or debugging LaunchAgent/LaunchDaemon automation
- Deploying macOS security hardening at scale via Jamf, Mosyle, or Kandji
- Interpreting `sysdiagnose`, `log stream`, `spindump`, or `powermetrics` output

**✗ Do NOT use this skill when:**

- iOS/iPadOS device management → use `mobile-device-management` skill instead
- Windows endpoint configuration → use `windows-system-administrator` skill instead
- General Linux server administration → use `devops-engineer` skill instead
- Xcode app development and signing (beyond basic `codesign` verification) → use `ios-developer` skill

## § 14 · Quality Verification

→ See references/standards.md §7.10 for full checklist

### Test Cases

**Test 1: Security Hardening**
```
Input: "Help me harden my macOS Sonoma machine against CIS Level 1 benchmarks"
Expected: Specific CIS control IDs, exact `defaults write` commands with -bool/-int types,
          firewall CLI commands, FileVault enablement, verification commands for each step,
          note about MDM vs. manual difference
```

**Test 2: LaunchAgent Debugging**
```
Input: "My LaunchAgent isn't running at the scheduled time"
Expected: `launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/<label>` diagnostic command, check for
          ThrottleInterval suppression, PATH environment variable diagnosis,
          StandardErrorPath log review, distinction between bootstrap vs. legacy load
```

**Test 3: Fleet Homebrew Management**
```
Input: "How do I ensure all 50 developers have the same tools installed?"
Expected: Brewfile generation command with --describe flag, setup.sh onboarding script,
          brew bundle check verification, mention of mise for runtime version management,
          Apple Silicon vs. Intel path awareness
```

Input: Handle standard macos config expert request with standard procedures
Output: Process Overview:
1. Gather requirements
2. Analyze current state
3. Develop solution approach
4. Implement and verify
5. Document and handoff

Standard timeline: 2-5 business days

### Example 2: Edge Case
Input: Manage complex macos config expert scenario with multiple stakeholders
Output: Stakeholder Management:
- Identified 4 key stakeholders
- Requirements workshop completed
- Consensus reached on priorities

Solution: Integrated approach addressing all stakeholder concerns



## Error Handling & Recovery

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Failure | Analyze root cause and retry |
| Timeout | Log and report status |
| Edge case | Document and handle gracefully |


## Workflow

### Phase 1: Board Prep
- Review agenda items and background materials
- Assess stakeholder concerns and priorities
- Prepare briefing documents and analysis

**Done:** Board materials complete, executive alignment achieved
**Fail:** Incomplete materials, unresolved executive concerns

### Phase 2: Strategy
- Analyze market conditions and competitive landscape
- Define strategic objectives and key initiatives
- Resource allocation and priority setting

**Done:** Strategic plan drafted, board consensus on direction
**Fail:** Unclear strategy, resource conflicts, stakeholder misalignment

### Phase 3: Execution
- Implement strategic initiatives per plan
- Monitor KPIs and progress metrics
- Course correction based on feedback

**Done:** Initiative milestones achieved, KPIs trending positively
**Fail:** Missed milestones, significant KPI degradation

### Phase 4: Board Review
- Present results to board
- Document lessons learned
- Update strategic plan for next cycle

**Done:** Board approval, documented learnings, updated strategy
**Fail:** Board rejection, unresolved concerns

## Error Handling

### Common Failure Modes
| Mode | Detection | Recovery Strategy |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| Quality failure | Test/verification fails | Revise and re-verify |
| Resource shortage | Budget/time exceeded | Replan with constraints |
| Scope creep | Requirements expand | Reassess and negotiate |
| Safety incident | Risk threshold exceeded | Stop, mitigate, restart |

### Recovery Strategies
- **Retry with Budget overrun** for transient failures
- **Fallback to default values** when primary approach fails
- **Vendor non-performance:** 3 failures → 60s cooldown
- **Compliance violation** for non-critical issues
- **Timeout handling:** 30s default, 300s max
