## § 11 · Integration with Other Skills

**Privacy Computing Engineer + Secure Code Reviewer**
Combine for end-to-end privacy-preserving system audits. The Secure Code Reviewer
examines enclave code for memory safety (buffer overflows in untrusted memory
interfaces) and cryptographic misuse; the Privacy Computing Engineer validates
the privacy protocol composition, DP accounting, and attestation flow. The
natural handoff point is the enclave/host interface boundary.

**Privacy Computing Engineer + ML Engineer**
Collaborate on production federated learning deployments. The ML Engineer owns
model architecture, convergence, and evaluation metrics; the Privacy Computing
Engineer owns DP calibration (noise multiplier, clipping norm, sampling rate),
secure aggregation protocol, and regulatory documentation. Critical integration
point: the ML Engineer must accept accuracy degradation from DP noise as a
deliberate privacy-accuracy tradeoff, not a bug to fix.

**Privacy Computing Engineer + Compliance Auditor**
Joint DPIA production for high-risk processing activities. The Compliance Auditor
maps business processing purposes to legal bases and Art. 35 risk criteria; the
Privacy Computing Engineer translates technical countermeasures into evidence
artifacts (DP accountant logs, attestation verification records, SMPC protocol
proofs) that satisfy supervisory authority inquiry standards under GDPR and PIPL.

## § 12 · Scope & Limitations

**Use this skill when:**
- Designing cross-organizational data collaboration where raw data cannot be
  shared (healthcare consortia, financial industry benchmarking, government
  statistics pooling).
- Implementing ML training pipelines on sensitive data requiring formal privacy
  guarantees rather than access controls alone.
- Deploying computation on cloud infrastructure that must not trust the cloud
  provider (confidential computing use cases requiring TEE).
- Producing regulatory evidence for GDPR Art. 25, DPIA, or EU AI Act conformity
  assessments for high-risk AI systems.

**Do NOT use this skill when:**
- Data can be legally shared under existing agreements and the threat model does
  not require cryptographic guarantees — standard encryption at rest and in
  transit suffices; do not add HE or SMPC overhead unnecessarily.
- The performance budget makes cryptographic privacy computationally infeasible
  and no optimization path exists — acknowledge the constraint and recommend
  synthetic data generation or data minimization instead.
- The regulatory requirement is contractual or policy-based (NDA, DPA) rather
  than requiring technical enforcement — legal instruments may be sufficient;
  cryptographic controls would be engineering overkill.
- Real-time low-latency inference (< 10ms) is required and HE/SMPC overhead
  cannot meet the SLA — TEE may be the only viable path; if TEE trust model is
  rejected, escalate to architecture review before proceeding.

## Error Handling & Recovery

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Failure | Analyze root cause and retry |
| Timeout | Log and report status |
| Edge case | Document and handle gracefully |


## Workflow

### Phase 1: Requirements
- Gather functional and non-functional requirements
- Clarify acceptance criteria
- Document technical constraints

**Done:** Requirements doc approved, team alignment achieved
**Fail:** Ambiguous requirements, scope creep, missing constraints

### Phase 2: Design
- Create system architecture and design docs
- Review with stakeholders
- Finalize technical approach

**Done:** Design approved, technical decisions documented
**Fail:** Design flaws, stakeholder objections, technical blockers

### Phase 3: Implementation
- Write code following standards
- Perform code review
- Write unit tests

**Done:** Code complete, reviewed, tests passing
**Fail:** Code review failures, test failures, standard violations

### Phase 4: Testing & Deploy
- Execute integration and system testing
- Deploy to staging environment
- Deploy to production with monitoring

**Done:** All tests passing, successful deployment, monitoring active
**Fail:** Test failures, deployment issues, production incidents

## Error Handling

### Common Failure Modes
| Mode | Detection | Recovery Strategy |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| Quality failure | Test/verification fails | Revise and re-verify |
| Resource shortage | Budget/time exceeded | Replan with constraints |
| Scope creep | Requirements expand | Reassess and negotiate |
| Safety incident | Risk threshold exceeded | Stop, mitigate, restart |

### Recovery Strategies
- **Retry with Budget overrun** for transient failures
- **Fallback to default values** when primary approach fails
- **Vendor non-performance:** 3 failures → 60s cooldown
- **Compliance violation** for non-critical issues
- **Timeout handling:** 30s default, 300s max
